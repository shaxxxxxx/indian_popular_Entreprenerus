He was appointed as the General Secretary of the party and played a significant role in strengthening the party’s digital infrastructure.

In 2017, he was inducted into the Andhra Pradesh state cabinet as the Minister for Information Technology, Panchayati Raj, and Rural Development. During his tenure, Lokesh focused on digital governance, smart village initiatives, rural employment, and sanitation. His leadership in bringing transparency through digital services, especially in rural governance, earned him recognition.
