          Early Life
          Born in 1953 in Bangalore, Kiran was raised in a progressive family that encouraged education. Her father was a brewmaster, and she initially wanted to follow in his footsteps.
          
          Education Journey
          She graduated in Zoology from Bangalore University and later pursued brewing science in Australia—becoming the first woman to qualify as a brewmaster in India.
          
          Business Journey
          In 1978, with just ₹10,000 in her garage, Kiran founded Biocon to manufacture enzymes. At the time, biotechnology was practically unknown in India, and she faced skepticism for being a woman in a male-dominated industry.
          
          Through relentless innovation, global collaborations, and R&D, Biocon grew into a biopharmaceutical giant. Kiran became a pioneer in affordable insulin, cancer, and auto-immune treatments. She is now one of India’s richest self-made women and an advocate for STEM education, innovation, and healthcare accessibility.
