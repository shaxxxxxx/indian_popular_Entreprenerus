                <p class="profile-desc"></p>
                Mark Elliot Zuckerberg, born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New
                York, is one of the most prominent figures in the digital age. Raised
                in nearby Dobbs Ferry, he grew up in a well-educated and supportive
                family. His father, Edward Zuckerberg, is a dentist, and his mother,
                Karen Kempner, is a psychiatrist. Mark was the only boy among four
                siblings and was known for his intelligence and curiosity from an
                early age. Zuckerberg’s interest in computers began in middle school.
                By the age of 12, he had created a messaging program called "ZuckNet"
                for his father’s dental practice. This early creation hinted at his
                future potential in software development. His parents recognized his
                talent and hired a private computer tutor. In high school at Phillips
                Exeter Academy, Zuckerberg excelled academically and continued
                developing software, including a music player called Synapse, which
                attracted attention from companies like Microsoft and AOL. He,
                however, turned down their offers and instead chose to attend Harvard
                University in 2002. At Harvard, Zuckerberg initially focused on
                psychology and computer science. During his sophomore year, he
                launched a website called "Facemash", a controversial site that
                allowed students to rate their peers' attractiveness. Though the site
                was quickly shut down by the university, it sparked the idea for what
                would become Facebook. In February 2004, Mark and his college
                roommates — Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz, Andrew McCollum, and
                Chris Hughes — launched TheFacebook.com, initially limited to Harvard
                students. The site quickly spread to other Ivy League universities and
                then to colleges across the United States. Recognizing the potential
                of the platform, Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard in 2004 and moved
                to Palo Alto, California, to focus on Facebook full-time. Over the
                years, the platform evolved into Facebook, the world’s largest social
                networking site. Zuckerberg’s vision was clear: to connect people
                globally. Under his leadership, Facebook introduced features such as
                the News Feed, Pages, Messenger, and more. In 2012, Facebook went
                public, making Zuckerberg one of the youngest self-made billionaires
                at the age of 28. Mark's success didn't stop with Facebook. He went on
                to acquire several companies including Instagram (2012), WhatsApp
                (2014), and Oculus VR (2014), expanding Facebook's reach into
                different areas of technology and communication. In 2021, Zuckerberg
                rebranded Facebook’s parent company to Meta Platforms Inc., reflecting
                his ambitions to build the metaverse — a virtual shared space blending
                augmented and virtual reality. Despite controversies over privacy,
                misinformation, and the platform’s influence on society, Zuckerberg
                remains a central figure in the tech industry. He has also committed
                to philanthropy through the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, co-founded
                with his wife Priscilla Chan, pledging to donate a majority of their
                wealth to causes related to education, science, and equality. From a
                precocious child fascinated by coding to a global tech leader shaping
                the future of the internet, Mark Zuckerberg’s journey is a compelling
                story of vision, innovation, and relentless drive.
