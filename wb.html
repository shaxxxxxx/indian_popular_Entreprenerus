Business Journey
He joined Google in 2004 as a product manager and soon became instrumental in the development of Google Toolbar and Chrome, which changed the way people accessed the web.

Over the years, he climbed ranks, managing Android, Chrome OS, and Google Apps. In 2015, he became CEO of Google, and in 2019, CEO of Alphabet Inc.

Pichai is known for his humility, clarity, and user-first vision. Under his leadership, Google has grown into a global AI, cloud, and hardware powerhouse.
