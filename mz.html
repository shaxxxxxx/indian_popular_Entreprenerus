          Early Life
          Lalnunmawia was born in Mizoram, a northeastern state of India rich in biodiversity. Fascinated by plants and ecosystems from a young age, he decided to pursue a path in botany and environmental sciences.
          
          Education Journey
          He earned his PhD in Botany and conducted extensive research in ethnobotany and biodiversity. He studied both in India and abroad, participating in numerous fieldwork programs and academic exchanges.
          
          Business Journey
          While Lalnunmawia is primarily an academic, he has also contributed to eco-entrepreneurship and community education. He has launched initiatives to train farmers, educate students, and document medicinal plants for sustainable use.
          
          As a member of the Mizoram Biodiversity Board, he played a critical role in policy-making, conservation, and public awareness. He’s also been involved in local governance and education reforms to promote science-backed entrepreneurship in rural communities.
