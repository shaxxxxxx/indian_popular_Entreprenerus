                Elon Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa, to Maye Musk, a Canadian model and
                dietitian, and Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer. A highly curious and introverted
                child, Musk developed an early interest in computing and technology, teaching himself computer
                programming at the age of 10 and selling his first game, Blastar, by the age of 12. Growing up in
                apartheid-era South Africa, he faced bullying and a complex family life, eventually choosing to leave
                his homeland at 17 to avoid mandatory military service and to pursue greater opportunities abroad. He
                first moved to Canada in 1989, enrolling at Queen’s University in Ontario, which also helped him gain
                easier entry into the United States. After two years, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania,
                earning dual degrees in Physics and Economics from the College of Arts and Sciences and the Wharton
                School. Musk then briefly pursued a PhD in applied physics at Stanford University but dropped out after
                just two days in 1995 to enter the rapidly growing internet industry.

                His entrepreneurial journey began with Zip2, a city guide software for newspapers, which he co-founded
                with his brother Kimbal. The company was sold to Compaq in 1999 for nearly $300 million, earning Musk
                $22 million. He reinvested this into X.com, an online financial services company, which later became
                PayPal after a merger and pivot toward digital payments; PayPal was acquired by eBay in 2002 for $1.5
                billion in stock, making Musk a multimillionaire. Driven by a vision for humanity’s future beyond Earth,
                Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 with the goal of making space travel affordable and eventually colonizing
                Mars. Despite several early rocket failures, SpaceX achieved success with the Falcon 1, then Falcon 9
                and Dragon spacecraft, becoming the first private company to send astronauts to the ISS in 2020. In
                2004, he joined Tesla Motors (now Tesla, Inc.) as chairman and later CEO, pushing electric vehicle
                innovation despite public skepticism, funding challenges, and production issues. Under his leadership,
                Tesla developed the Roadster, Model S, Model 3, Model X, and Model Y, while also expanding into battery
                storage and solar energy through acquisitions like SolarCity.

                In addition to Tesla and SpaceX, Musk has launched or supported several futuristic ventures. He founded
                The Boring Company to build tunnels and reduce urban traffic, launched Neuralink to explore
                brain-machine interfaces, and initiated OpenAI to promote beneficial AI development. In 2022, he
                acquired Twitter (later rebranded as X), citing concerns over free speech and content moderation, and
                implemented controversial reforms. Musk is known for his intense work ethic, often working 80–100 hours
                per week, and his polarizing public persona marked by bold claims, ambitious deadlines, and active
                Twitter engagement. Despite criticism for his management style and unpredictable behavior, Musk has
                become one of the wealthiest and most influential individuals in the world, seen by many as a visionary
                entrepreneur pushing the boundaries of energy, transportation, and space. His life embodies relentless
                ambition, risk-taking, and a drive to solve what he sees as humanity’s most pressing problems—from
                climate change to multiplanetary existence.
