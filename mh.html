          Early Life
          Sachin Bansal was born in 1981 in Chandigarh. He came from a family with an engineering background—his father was in business and his mother was a homemaker. He developed a deep interest in computers and problem-solving at an early age.
          
          Education Journey
          He graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi in 2005 with a degree in Computer Science. While at IIT, he developed strong programming and analytical skills, preparing him for a career in technology and entrepreneurship.
          
          Business Journey
          Sachin began his career at Techspan, then joined Amazon as a software engineer. In 2007, along with Binny Bansal, he launched Flipkart, initially as an online bookstore.
          
          Flipkart quickly scaled into a full-fledged e-commerce platform, pioneering online shopping in India. It revolutionized logistics, cash-on-delivery, and customer trust in e-commerce. Sachin served as CEO and later Executive Chairman before stepping down in 2018.
          
          Under his leadership, Flipkart became India’s largest online retailer and was eventually acquired by Walmart for $16 billion—the largest e-commerce deal in history at the time.
          
          After exiting Flipkart, he founded Navi Technologies, focusing on fintech, lending, and insurance, continuing his passion for tech-driven disruption.
