          Early Life
          Zubair Ahmad was born in Tamil Nadu, India. He came from a humble background, and like many first-generation entrepreneurs, had to work his way up from the bottom. Growing up, he witnessed the inefficiencies in India’s supply chain and logistics industry, which later influenced his entrepreneurial path.
          
          Education Journey
          Zubair completed his education in Logistics and Supply Chain Management, which provided him with both academic knowledge and industry insight. He also worked with logistics firms early in his career, gaining hands-on experience.
          
          Business Journey
          Zubair founded Daily Logistics, a startup that focuses on making freight forwarding and logistics more efficient using tech-driven solutions. His company aims to improve real-time tracking, warehousing, and transportation processes for businesses.
          
          Starting with a small team, he built Daily Logistics into a trusted partner for many industries like manufacturing, e-commerce, and food delivery. Zubair focused on customer service, transparency, and innovation, which set his business apart.
          
          He is an active mentor and speaker in startup circles and encourages youth to solve real-world problems through entrepreneurship.
