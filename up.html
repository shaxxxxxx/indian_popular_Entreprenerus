          Early Life
          Born in Bangalore, Varun grew up with a passion for filmmaking, storytelling, and startups. His mother wanted him to follow a more conventional path, which he humorously documented in his future writings.
          
          Education Journey
          He studied engineering, though he wasn’t deeply invested in academics. He soon followed his passion for media and entrepreneurship, moving into creative work.
          
          Business Journey
          Varun co-founded Alma Mater, a startup that makes customized merchandise for schools and colleges. He also founded The Unacademy (not to be confused with the edtech giant) and Last Minute Films, a production house.
          
          His book, “How I Braved Anu Aunty and Co-founded a Million Dollar Company,” became a cult hit among Indian youth, inspiring many to embrace unconventional careers. He’s now a public speaker, filmmaker, and youth icon.
