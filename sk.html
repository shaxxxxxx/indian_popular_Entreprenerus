          Early Life
          Sonam was born in 1966 in Ladakh, a remote region of India. He didn’t attend school until the age of 9 and was largely self-taught due to the lack of infrastructure and poor education systems in the region.
          
          Education Journey
          After schooling, he pursued mechanical engineering at NIT Srinagar. Later, he studied architecture at École de Technologie Supérieure in Canada to focus on sustainable and context-specific education.
          
          Business Journey
          Sonam founded the Students' Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh (SECMOL), reforming local education by making it practical, nature-aligned, and language-accessible.
          
          He also invented the Ice Stupa, a glacier-like structure to combat water scarcity in the Himalayas. His work blends science, sustainability, and education, and inspired the character of Phunsukh Wangdu in the movie 3 Idiots.
          
          His impact continues through HIAL (Himalayan Institute of Alternatives), where he nurtures thinkers and doers for a better world.
