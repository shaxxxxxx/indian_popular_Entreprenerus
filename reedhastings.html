                </p>
                Wilmot Reed Hastings Jr., widely known as the co-founder and former CEO of Netflix, was born on October
                8, 1960, in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. He grew up in a well-educated family; his father was an attorney
                for the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare under President Nixon. This environment
                instilled in him a strong sense of curiosity and discipline from an early age.

                Hastings attended Buckingham Browne & Nichols School, a private preparatory school in Cambridge,
                Massachusetts. After graduating in 1978, he enrolled at Bowdoin College, a liberal arts college in
                Maine. There, he majored in mathematics, a subject that fascinated him for its logic and structure.
                Hastings graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics in 1983.

                After college, rather than immediately pursuing a corporate career, Hastings joined the Peace Corps, a
                move that reflected his adventurous and service-oriented spirit. He spent two years teaching math in
                Swaziland (now Eswatini), Africa. This experience broadened his worldview and taught him resilience,
                problem-solving, and independence—qualities that would later define his leadership style.

                Upon returning to the United States, Hastings pursued further education and enrolled at Stanford
                University, where he earned a Master’s degree in Computer Science in 1988. At Stanford, he became deeply
                interested in software development and entrepreneurship.

                In 1991, Hastings founded his first company, Pure Software, which created tools to help developers
                troubleshoot and debug their code. Although the company initially struggled, Hastings learned valuable
                lessons about managing growth and company culture. Pure Software eventually became successful and was
                acquired by Rational Software in 1997 for $750 million. However, Hastings was dissatisfied with the
                bureaucratic nature of large organizations and began thinking about starting something new.

                In 1997, the idea for Netflix was born, reportedly after Hastings was charged a $40 late fee for
                returning a VHS copy of Apollo 13. With co-founder Marc Randolph, he launched Netflix as a DVD
                rental-by-mail service. The model was simple but disruptive, allowing customers to rent DVDs online and
                receive them by mail without due dates or late fees.

                Over the years, Hastings transformed Netflix from a DVD rental business into a streaming giant,
                launching its streaming service in 2007. He boldly invested in original content, beginning with House of
                Cards in 2013, setting Netflix apart from traditional media companies. Under his leadership, Netflix
                expanded globally and became a pioneer in producing award-winning shows and films, such as Stranger
                Things, The Crown, and Roma.

                Reed Hastings’ impact on the entertainment industry is profound. He redefined how the world consumes
                content, championing on-demand streaming and binge-watching culture. Beyond business, he is also known
                for his contributions to education reform, donating millions to charter school initiatives and promoting
                technology in classrooms.

                In 2020, he co-authored the book "No Rules Rules" with Erin Meyer, outlining Netflix’s unique corporate
                culture based on freedom and responsibility.

                In 2023, Hastings stepped down as co-CEO of Netflix, transitioning to the role of Executive Chairman.
                His legacy remains as one of the most forward-thinking leaders in Silicon Valley, known for his bold
                risks, data-driven strategies, and deep belief in innovation and creativity.
