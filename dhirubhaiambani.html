                <p class="profile-desc"></p>
                Dhirajlal Hirachand Ambani, popularly known as Dhirubhai Ambani, was
                born on December 28, 1932, in the small village of Chorwad, in the
                Junagadh district of Gujarat, India. He was born into a modest family;
                his father, Hirachand Gordhanbhai Ambani, was a schoolteacher, and his
                mother, Jamnaben, was a homemaker. Growing up in a household with
                limited means, Dhirubhai learned the values of thrift, hard work, and
                ambition early in life. Due to the family’s financial constraints,
                Dhirubhai’s formal education was limited. He completed his schooling
                up to matriculation (10th grade). Although he could not pursue a
                college education, his sharp mind, street-smart attitude, and hunger
                to succeed proved to be far more valuable in the long run. At the age
                of 17, Dhirubhai left for Aden (Yemen), then a British colony, where
                he worked as a clerk for A. Besse & Co., a trading firm dealing in
                petroleum products. During his years in Aden, he gained a solid
                understanding of trade, shipping, currency arbitrage, and
                international markets. This practical exposure laid the foundation for
                his entrepreneurial ambitions. In 1958, Dhirubhai returned to India
                with modest savings and set up a small business in Mumbai (then
                Bombay). Along with his cousin Champaklal Damani, he started an
                import-export business named Reliance Commercial Corporation, trading
                in polyester yarn and spices. The business grew steadily, and by the
                1960s, Dhirubhai began venturing into textile manufacturing. In 1966,
                he established a textile mill in Naroda, Gujarat, and soon launched
                the brand “Vimal”, which became synonymous with high-quality and
                affordable fabric in India. His success was not just in manufacturing
                but also in branding and retailing. He revolutionized the textile
                industry by building a nationwide retail network and introducing
                polyester to Indian consumers. The turning point came in the 1970s and
                1980s when Dhirubhai took the bold step of entering the Indian stock
                market. He listed Reliance Industries on the Bombay Stock Exchange in
                1977, making it one of the first Indian companies to attract ordinary
                investors in large numbers. His ability to build trust among small
                investors and reward them with handsome returns became legendary.
                Under his dynamic leadership, Reliance Industries diversified beyond
                textiles into petrochemicals, refining, telecommunications, energy,
                and infrastructure. His vision was clear: to build a self-reliant
                India through world-class industries. Despite facing criticism,
                political opposition, and regulatory hurdles, he persisted with
                courage and strategic insight. By the late 1990s, Reliance had become
                India’s largest private-sector enterprise, and Dhirubhai was widely
                admired for turning a small trading company into a corporate
                powerhouse. He was honored with numerous awards and was posthumously
                awarded the Padma Vibhushan in 2016 for his contribution to Indian
                industry. Dhirubhai Ambani passed away on July 6, 2002, at the age of
                69. After his death, the Reliance empire was split between his two
                sons, Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani. Mukesh continues to lead Reliance
                Industries Limited (RIL), which remains a pillar of the Indian
                economy. Dhirubhai’s journey from a rural village boy with little
                formal education to one of India’s most iconic industrialists is a
                story of vision, grit, and relentless ambition. He famously said,
                “Think big, think fast, think ahead. Ideas are no one’s monopoly.” His
                life is a powerful reminder that determination and entrepreneurship
                can break through any barrier.
